## Description

Github Finder is an application to find Github Users by name.
This project is a React app built using JavaScript. Using Axios to make API calls to Github and React Router to render the app's different components. The app was created with CSS (that was provided as a folder in the course) and was an exercise to get introduced to useContext and useReducer.
the course was made using react router v5 however since i installed the v6 version i had to modify and adapt the content.
